# CSCI 4831 Final Project
### Michael Hering

#### The Hit Effectiveness Statistic (HE):
For this project, I will analyze what types of hits produce the most offensive gain for a team by comparing certain features of hits to wOBA. More specifically, I will use the statcast data of the speed, angle, and position of hits to analyze if there is a relationship between these factors and how often a hit produces an advantage for the offense. This statistic, known as hit effectiveness (HE) will be able to identify what types of hits, evaluated by angle, speed, and position, are the most valuable for a batter to produce. As an extension of this, we will also look at what the overall HE is for a certain batter’s hits in order to value that player’s hitting quality. We will then take the batters with the top 10 HE scores and visualize their hit placement as well as speed and angle.

Explanation of data gathered and methods used to analyze data

In order to present this statistic, I show the correlation for all hits concerning hit angle and outcome, hit speed and outcome, as well as hit location and outcome. I also show the correlation for all hits concerning hit angle and wOBA as well as hit speed and wOBA. Finally, I analyze the HE score for different batters hit’s to determine which batters produce the best hits.
